# Machine-Learning

I have collected a set of reviews from a local retsaurant and formatted them into a tsv file. The reason for doing this is i wanted to understand wether we were able to apply Machine learning
to our real world problems.

What I mean by real world is! We might have biased opinions when we hear something about ccertain something. 

So gathering a bunch of dogmatic reviews and applying the model was fun.

Conclusion:-

At the end the result was astonishing , The restaurant reviews most of them were positive as what i have heard them in my neighborhood some were negative.
Most were positive so as a result it was a good restaurant.
